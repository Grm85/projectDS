Interactive Churn Analytics: From SQL to Dash Plotly - Integrating Data Management, Predictive Modeling, and Visualization for Churn Insights

Project Overview
This project analyzes and predicts customer churn to help businesses understand and mitigate churn risk. We loaded customer data from CSV, performed data cleaning and processing in SQL, visualized insights with Power BI, and built a predictive model for future churn analysis. Our model assesses churn risk for both existing customers and new joiners, with visualized results available through an interactive dashboard built using Plotly Dash.

Technologies Used
SQL: Data cleaning and handling.
Python: For data manipulation and model training (Pandas, Scikit-Learn).
Power BI: Visualization of customer insights and churn patterns.
Plotly Dash: Interactive web dashboard for real-time insights.
Machine Learning: Random Forest Classifier for churn prediction.

Data Processing
Data Loading: Loaded customer data from CSV.
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, handled categorical variables, and ensured data quality in SQL.
Data Integration: Stored cleaned data for easy retrieval and future processing.

Machine Learning Model
Model Selection: Used a Random Forest Classifier for predicting customer churn.
Training: Split the data into training and test sets, trained the model, and tuned hyperparameters to achieve optimal accuracy.
Prediction: Predicted churn likelihood for both existing and new customers.
Data Visualization
Power BI Dashboards: Created dashboards to visualize customer demographics, churn patterns, and predictions. Updated regularly with prediction data.

Web Dashboard
Plotly Dash: Developed an interactive web dashboard to visualize real-time insights and churn predictions for decision-makers.
